INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING THE NANCY PELOSI IMAGE

1. Save the Nancy Pelosi image shown in your conversation to this directory (assets/)
2. Name the file "pelosi.png"
3. Make sure the image has a transparent background for best results

If you don't have the exact image, any headshot of Nancy Pelosi with a transparent background will work.

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
If you want to test the game before adding the actual image, you can create a simple placeholder:

1. Open Paint or any image editor
2. Create a new image (recommended size: 300x300 pixels)
3. Draw a simple face or write "PELOSI" in large text
4. Save it as "pelosi.png" in this directory

The game will use whatever image is saved as "pelosi.png" in this directory.
